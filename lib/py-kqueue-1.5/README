Updated the constants, removed the KQueue.py cruft, and changed it to
the kqueue module instead of KQueue.

After a brief email dicussion with dwhite@freebsd.org, I took possession
of this.  I don't have the ambition he states below, but I needed to add
several different event types.  While adding the ones I required, I added
others from the file.

This is an early version of a Python module to handle kernel queues (kqueues) 
as implemented by Johnathan Lemon (jlemon@freebsd.org).  Information on the 
kqueue system and patches are at http://www.flugsvamp.com/~jlemon/fbsd/kq.txt.

This version of PyKQueue, 1.2, supports the new kevent(2) API in FreeBSD 
4.1-RELEASE and 5-CURRENT (osreldate 50011).  

Sam Rushing and I are working on a totally revamped version of this module
that pushes all the code into C instead of the split system used here.  
The new module should be many times more efficient than this one. Stay tuned
for details.

Enjoy.
